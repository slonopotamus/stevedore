== Overview

This project aims to be a frictionless Docker distribution for Windows.

Stevedore can be used as a replacement for `DockerMsftProvider`, Docker Desktop or Mirantis Container Runtime.

Windows Containers are fully supported.

Linux Containers support is in _experimental mode_.

== Supported OSes

* Windows 10, 11
* Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022 (no Linux containers due to lack of WSL2)

== Installation

=== Chocolatey

Stevedore is available via https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/stevedore[Chocolatey] package manager.
If you already have Chocolatey installed, you can just run the following command from elevated console:

[source,bash]
----
choco install stevedore
----

Note that reboot is required before you can use `docker` commands.

=== WinGet

https://github.com/slonopotamus/stevedore/issues/15[Planned], but not available yet.

=== Manual

. Download {uri-project}/releases/latest[MSI installer]
. Double-click on it
. Next-next-next
. Reboot your computer.
This is needed to finish installation of Windows Containers feature and to add your user to `docker-users` group so user can access Docker service.
. Profit! `docker` command is now available on your PATH and `dockerd` service is already running.

=== Command-line install options

Stevedore installer supports several command-line options that may be handy to configure unattended installations.

Basic usage: `msiexec /i c:\path\to\stevedore.msi`.

For quiet (non-interactive) installation add `/quiet` option.

If you only want to install specific Stevedore features, use `/ADDLOCAL=Feature1,Feature2,Feature3` syntax.

.List of available MSI features for `/ADDLOCAL`
* `FeatureWindowsContainers` installs Windows Containers support, including Stevedore service.
It allows running containers with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container#process-isolation[process isolation].
* `FeatureHyperV` installs Hyper-V support.
It allows running containers with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container#hyper-v-isolation[Hyper-V isolation].
* `FeatureLinuxContainers` installs Linux Containers support.

You can also pass custom installation properties to Stevedore installer using `/PROPERTY=value` syntax.

.List of available MSI properties
* `/INSTALLDIR=%ProgramFiles%\Stevedore` specifies directory where Stevedore executable files will be installed
* `/SERVICENAME=stevedore` specifies Windows service name

When installing Stevedore via Chocolatey, use this syntax: `choco install stevedore --install-arguments="/ADDLOCAL=Feature1,Feature2,Feature3 /PROPERTY=value /quiet"`

== Bundled components

* Docker Engine 20.10.12
* Docker App 0.9.1-beta3
* Buildx 0.7.1
* Docker Compose 2.2.3
* Docker Scan 0.17.0

== Usage

After installation and reboot, `docker` command should be available on PATH and ready to use.

Just try `docker run hello-world` from a command line.

In order to communicate with Docker engine, users needs to be in `docker-users` group.
Upon installation, Stevedore automatically adds installing user to `docker-users`.
If you need other users to also access Docker engine, you will need to add them manually.
You can use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.localaccounts/add-localgroupmember[Add-LocalGroupMember] PowerShell commandlet for that.

=== Docker Compose

Stevedore installs two flavors of Docker Compose.

You can use Docker Compose V2 via `docker compose` command.

You can also use Docker Compose V1 compatibility mode via `docker-compose` command.

== Configuration and data files

Stevedore stores configuration and runtime data files under `%ProgramData%\Docker` directory.

== Building from source

. https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[Install Rust]
. Install https://wixtoolset.org/releases/https://wixtoolset.org/releases/[WiX Toolset] either manually or by running `choco install wixtoolset` if you have https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey]
. Clone Stevedore Git repository
. Run `cargo install cargo-wix` to install https://github.com/volks73/cargo-wix[cargo-wix]
. Run `cargo wix --nocapture` in repository root.
Ready-to-use MSI package will be built in `<repo>/target/wix` directory.

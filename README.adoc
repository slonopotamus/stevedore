== Overview

This project aims to provide a frictionless Docker experience for Windows Containers.

Stevedore can be used as a replacement for Docker Desktop, `DockerMsftProvider` or Mirantis Container Runtime.

*Only Windows Containers are supported.*

If you want to run Linux containers, consider one of these projects:

* https://rancherdesktop.io/[Rancher Desktop] (Windows + Linux + Mac)
* https://container-desktop.io/[Container Desktop] (Windows-only)
* https://github.com/abiosoft/colima[Colima] (Mac-only)

== Supported OSes

* Windows 10 starting with version 1809 (build 17763)
* Windows 11
* Windows Server 2019, 2022

== Installation

=== Manual

. Download {uri-project}/releases/latest[MSI installer]
. Double-click on it
. Next-next-next
. Reboot your computer.
This is needed to finish installation of Windows Containers feature and to add your user to `docker-users` group so user can access Docker service.

=== Chocolatey

Stevedore is available via https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/stevedore[Chocolatey] package manager.
If you already have Chocolatey installed, you can just run the following command from elevated console:

[source,powershell]
----
choco install stevedore
----

Then reboot.

=== WinGet

[source,powershell]
----
winget install stevedore
----

Then reboot.

=== Advanced: Command-line install options

Stevedore installer supports several command-line options that may be handy to configure unattended installations.

Basic usage: `msiexec /i c:\path\to\stevedore.msi`.

For quiet (non-interactive) installation add `/quiet` option.

If you only want to install specific Stevedore features, use `ADDLOCAL=Feature1,Feature2,Feature3` syntax.

.List of available MSI features for `ADDLOCAL`
* `FeatureHyperV` installs Hyper-V support.
It allows running containers with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container#hyper-v-isolation[Hyper-V isolation].

You can also pass custom installation properties to Stevedore installer using `PROPERTY=value` syntax.

.List of available MSI properties
* `INSTALLDIR=%ProgramFiles%\Stevedore` specifies directory where Stevedore executable files will be installed
* `SERVICENAME=stevedore` specifies Windows service name

When installing Stevedore via Chocolatey, use this syntax: `choco install stevedore --install-arguments="ADDLOCAL=Feature1,Feature2,Feature3 PROPERTY=value /quiet"`

== Bundled components

* Docker Engine 23.0.0
* Docker Compose 2.13.1
* Docker Scan 0.23.0
* docker-credential-wincred 0.7.0

== Usage

After installation and reboot, `docker` command should be available on PATH and ready to use.

You may try `docker run --rm hello-world` from a command line to confirm that everything was set up properly.

In order to communicate with Docker engine, users needs to be in `docker-users` group.
Upon installation, Stevedore automatically adds installing user to `docker-users`.
If you need other users to also access Docker engine, you will need to add them manually.
You can use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.localaccounts/add-localgroupmember[Add-LocalGroupMember] PowerShell commandlet for that.

=== Docker Compose

Stevedore installs two flavors of Docker Compose.

You can use Docker Compose V2 via `docker compose` command.

You can also use Docker Compose V1 compatibility mode via `docker-compose` command.

=== Configuration and data files

Stevedore stores configuration and runtime data files for Windows containers under `%ProgramData%\Docker` directory.
